# This file controls the workers found within a cluster

# The worker node groups for the cluster
nodeGroups:
  # names of node groups need to be a valid hostname, not an fqdn (e.g _ or . cannot be in the name)
  - # This group uses details found in nodeGroupDefault below
    # and is enabled by default
    name: default-md-0
    # The number of machines in the node group if autoscale is false
    machineCount: 5

  # The following node groups are optional and can be enabled by uncommenting them
  # - name: md-l3-small
  #   machineFlavor: l3.small
  #   machineCount: 1
  # - name: md-rtx4000
  #   machineFlavor: g-rtx4000.x1
  #   machineCount: 1

# Defaults for node groups
nodeGroupDefaults:
  # Indicates if the node group should be autoscaled
